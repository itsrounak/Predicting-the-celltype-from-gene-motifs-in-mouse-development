# Predicting-the-celltype-from-gene-motifs-in-mouse-development

# Purpose
This project provides the opportunity for practising your supervised learning skills. The competition format enables to objectively compare how well your model performs against other models.

This is also a place where we can exercise our creativity. We will also want to explore the data, how the distribution varies between classes, what fires are hard to classify, and why. Its an opportunity to practice our data exploration skills, too.

# Task
This is a KaggleInClass challenge, you can find at https://www.kaggle.com/c/antechinus/.

Our task was to predict the celltype of the samples based on the gene expression values. Celltype is one of 10 possibilities (cardiomyocyte, endothelium, erythroid, forebrain, gut, mesenchyme, mid_hindbrain, neural_crest, somitic_mesoderm, spinalCord). The classes are a little imbalanced. We were expected to build a model to predict which it is, as accurately as possible.
